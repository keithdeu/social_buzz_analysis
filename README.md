# Social Media Data Analysis with Excel, SQL, and Power BI

In this project, we clean data from 3 datasets of a growing social media platform. The CSV files are included, with the cleaned data being labeled "_Clean" at the end. 

Then we merged the tables using nested queries and multiple join statements, and export the resulting table to a CSV file "MergedTables."

After this, we gain insights on the merged data using Power BI, creating visualizations looking into the top 5 categories most popular on the platform. I created a dashboard using some of the insights gained from the visualizations.

We present the analysis in the form of a powerpoint presentation. I created a video presenting the data, the file was too big for github. It can be found here https://www.dropbox.com/s/fqslo6yh99hqw6f/Presentation.mp4?dl=0
